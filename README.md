# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

This project explores student exam performance based on various demographic and educational factors. Using Python (Pandas) for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Power BI** for data visualization, this project uncovers key insights into what impacts student outcomes.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given a dataset containing exam scores and demographic attributes of students. The objective is to perform in-depth analysis to uncover what influences student performance and present it visually using Power BI.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
* **Columns:**

  * `gender`
  * `race/ethnicity`
  * `parental level of education`
  * `lunch`
  * `test preparation course`
  * `math score`
  * `reading score`
  * `writing score`

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform detailed EDA using Pandas.
* Answer tricky and meaningful business questions.
* Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to showcase findings.
* Categorize students into performance categories using logic.

---

## 🧠 Key EDA Questions Answered

1. Which **parental education level** is linked with the highest average math score?
2. Is there a significant **gender-based performance** difference across all subjects?
3. How does **test preparation course completion** affect subject-wise scores?
4. Which **combination of gender, lunch, and test-prep status** produces top performers?
5. Does **lunch type** have uniform effects across **ethnic groups**, or does it vary?
6. What is the correlation between **reading vs. writing** and **math vs. writing**?
7. Who are the **top 5% performers** and what demographic patterns are visible?
8. Can we cluster students into **low/medium/high performance categories** using Pandas?
